Files from March 2018 were uploaded.  The ESFuNC_Functions and a template for setting up curve classification are now available.

June 20, 2017

To run the ESFuNC analysis, place all files in the repository into a single directory.  This includes

-ESFuNC_Analysis_Template_Tecator.R

-ESFuNC_Functions.R

-tecator.txt

Open ESFuNC_Analysis_Template_Tecator.R and follow the instructions within the comments.  The file contains a 
walkthrough of the analysis of the Tecator dataset and reproduces the Figure contained within the submitted 
manuscript.  The file can be sourced once the working directory has been set to contain the above files.  The
default setting is to run in parallel with 4 cores.  If this is not possible, be sure to read through the
file and make necassary changes.
